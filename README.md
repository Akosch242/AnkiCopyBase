## About
This is a small flashcard learning app, with login/register for easier organizing in case more people use your pc.
## Usage
After registraton and/or login you start creating your learning decks, these have cards with frontpage, backpage and hint options.
<br>
* frontpage: the text you see first
* backpage: what you should know
* hint: if you want to provide additional help
<br>
After creating your deck, head over to your deck list. Here you can choose from your decks to train,
they are shuffled at the start of every training, so you can not memorize only their order.

## Goals and why this
I have learned about MVC architecture in various curses and watched videos about it, but it did not really click, so I thought I should try it in practice. 
But I also did not want to overcomplicate it by choosing a new GUI option, so I sticked with the console application and focused on finding the right lines of seperation.
The idea came from the simple fact that I had Anki next to Visual Studio on my desktop.
